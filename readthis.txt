chatgpt   I am installing the DWS service, which allows for remote desktop sharing with other users. For that installation, it is providing dwagent. I want to install this with a few automations,it provides the dwsagent.sh file  like ,
For installation, there are few steps. 
[1.Download using sudo wget https://dwservice.net/download/dwagen_generic.sh
2. 1.Install 2.run 3. i dont accept [it should select 1.Install]
3. Select the installation path[set to default path ex:usr/share/dwagent]
4. confirmation of the installation path [would you like to install DWAGENT in usr/share/dwagent ] select yes
5.How would you like to like to configure the agent?
1. Enter the installation Code
2. creating a new agent 
select the first option (1. Enter the installation Code)
6.then it will ask for [Enter the installation code
on that time user should provide the installation code]

If the user provides all the steps, it will show the installation is completed.
I want to automate up to the 4th step. When this shell script runs, it should ask only the installation code from the user, then everything should be done automatically.
provide me the shell script for the installation file
