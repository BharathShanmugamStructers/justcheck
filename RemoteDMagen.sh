You can automate the installation steps by creating a shell script that interacts with the dwsagent.sh file. Below is a sample shell script that automates the process up to the point where the installation code needs to be entered:

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash

# Step 1: Download the dwagent_generic.sh script
echo "Downloading DWAgent installation script..."
sudo wget -O dwsagent.sh https://www.dwservice.net/download/dwagent_generic.sh

# Step 2: Make the script executable
echo "Making the script executable..."
sudo chmod +x dwsagent.sh

# Step 3: Automatically install the DWAgent
echo "Running the installation script..."
(
    # Automate the steps for installation
    echo "1"    # Select '1.Install'
    sleep 1
    echo "/usr/share/dwagent"  # Installation path set to /usr/share/dwagent
    sleep 1
    echo "y"    # Confirm installation path
    sleep 1
    echo "1"    # Select '1. Enter the installation Code'
) | sudo ./dwsagent.sh

# Step 4: Prompt the user for the installation code
echo "Please enter the installation code:"
read INSTALL_CODE

# Resume the installation process (if needed) by entering the code
echo "Installation will continue after you provide the code."
echo "Installation completed!"
How It Works:
Step 1: Downloads the dwsagent.sh script.
Step 2: Makes the script executable.
Step 3: Uses echo to provide automated inputs for the initial prompts, including selecting the install option, installation path, and confirming the path.
Step 4: Prompts the user for the installation code and pauses for the user's input. After that, you can extend the automation if needed.
Save this script to a file (e.g., auto_install_dwagent.sh), make it executable, and run it:

bash
Copy code
chmod +x auto_install_dwagent.sh
./auto_install_dwagent.sh
